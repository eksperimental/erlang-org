Hello!

We are pleased to announce the launch of the new erlang.org website!

The design and content are roughly the same as the old website. The most notable changes are:

* The blog is moved
  * [erlang.org/blog](/blog)
* New downloads page with all patches
  * [erlang.org/downloads](/downloads)
  * [erlang.org/downloads/24](/downloads/24)
  * [erlang.org/patches/OTP-24.1](/patches/OTP-24.1)
* The documentation has integrated full-text search by [algolia]
  * [erlang.org/doc/](/doc/)
  * Try searching for "lists", "erlang error" or "records"
* Updated and "flattened" docs for more versions
  * [erlang.org/docs/23/](/docs/23/)
  * [erlang.org/docs/17/](/docs/17/)

Some things from the old site has been removed:

* bugs.erlang.org has been removed and now redirects to [github.com/erlang/otp/issues](https://github.com/erlang/otp/issues)
* [erlang.org/erldoc](/erldoc) and [erlang.org/doc/search](/doc/search) have been replaced by algolia search
* The events section has been removed

The new website is built using Erlang + Jekyll + Bootstrap and the code is available here: [github.com/erlang/erlang-org/](https://github.com/erlang/erlang-org/)

Please report any problems that you find as issues on [github.com/erlang/erlang-org](https://github.com/erlang/erlang-org).

Lukas and the Erlang/OTP team
