The 15:th Erlang User Conference (EUC) on November 12:th was a great success. 
 This was the biggest EUC so far with around 250 partcipants.
 More info from the conference can be seen on the [Erlang-factory site](http://www.erlang-factory.com/conference/ErlangUserConference2009).
 Many thanks to all the sponsors and especially to Erlang Training and Consulting for making the conference so successful.
