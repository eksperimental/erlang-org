Erlang/OTP 18.2 is a service release on the 18 track with mostly bug fixes, but is does contain a number of new features and characteristics improvements as well. 

 Some highlights of the release are:

* erts: Add function enif_getenv to read OS environment variables in a portable way from NIFs.
* kernel: Add {line_delim, byte()} option to inet:setopts/2 and decode_packet/3
* ssh: The 'ecdsa-sha2-nistp256', 'ecdsa-sha2-nistp384' and 'ecdsa-sha2-nistp521' signature algorithms for ssh are implemented. See RFC 5656.
* ssh: The ssh:daemon option dh_gex_groups is extended to read a user provided ssh moduli file with generator-modulus pairs. The file is in openssh format.
